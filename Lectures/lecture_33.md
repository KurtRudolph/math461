## DNHI 
State and Prove markov's inequalit for non-discrete case.

## DNHI
Say \[X_n\] is # of heads in \[n\] tosses of a \[p = \frac{ 1}{ 4}\]
unfair coin. Use the discrete Markov inequality to estimate 
\[P( X_n \ge \frac{ 3}{ 4} n)\]

## DNHI
Use _Chebyshev's Inequality_ to estimate the probability that a
random varible is greater than 3 standard deviations from it's
mean.

## DNHI
Say the \[X\] is a \[n(0,1)\].  What is the probility it is
more than 3 standard deviations from it's mean?
