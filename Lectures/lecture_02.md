### Binomial Theorem
\[{\left( {1 + x} \right)^h} = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k \]

\[ {n \choose k} = \frac{ n!}{ k!( n - k)!}\]

\[{\left( {1 + x} \right)^h} = (1 + x)(1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3)\]

\[=\] \[1\] \[3x\] \[3x^2\] \[x^3\]


### Prop. 
\[ {n \choose k} + { n \choose k+1} = {n+1 \choose k+1}\]

\[ \frac{ n!}{ k!( n-k)!} + \frac{ n!}{ (k+1)!(n-k-1)!} 
= \frac{ n!}{k!(n-k-1)!} \left( \frac{ 1}{ n-k} + \frac{ 1}{ k+1} \right)\]

\[ \frac{ (n+1)!}{ (k+1)!(n-k)! } = {n+1 \choose k+1}\]

Chevalrer de Mere c.1654

__his bet__: I can get a 6 on a six sided dice in four tosses of a die.

His calculation: \[ 4 \times \frac{ 1}{ 6} = \frac{ 2}{ 3}\]

\[prob( Win) + prob( Loose) = 1 \]

\[p + \frac{ 5}{ 6}^4 = 1\]

\[ p = 1 - \frac{ 5}{ 6}^4 = 1 - \cdots \]

### ex

An immortal plays a game in which his chance of winning is \[ \frac{ 1}{ 3} \].
If he plays once per day what is the probability he eventually wins?
