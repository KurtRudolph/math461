## pg50_03

Two dice are thrown. Let \[E\] be the event that the sum of the 
dice is odd, let \[F\] be the event that at least one of the dice 
lands on 1, and let \[G\] be the event that the sum is \[5\]. Describe 
the events \[EF, E \cup F, FG, EF^c, EFG\].

* \[EF\]
  * The expression defines the space where one die laned on a 1 and the other 
    die langed on an even number.
* \[E \cup F\]
  * The expression defines the space where 
    * The sum of the dice is odd
    * One of the dice lands on 1
    * Both the proceeding bullets are true
* \[
