## pg50_03

Two dice are thrown. Let \[E\] be the event that the sum of the 
dice is odd, let \[F\] be the event that at least one of the dice 
lands on \[1\], and let \[G\] be the event that the sum is \[5\]. Describe 
the events \[EF, E \cup F, FG, EF^c, EFG\].

* \[EF\]
  * The expression defines the space where the sum of the dice is \[odd\] and 
    one die lands on a \[1\].
  * The expression implies that secend device must be \[even\] as only \[1 + even = odd\].
* \[E \cup F\]
  * The expression defines the space where 
    * The sum of the dice is odd.
    * One of the dice lands on \[1\].
    * Both the proceeding bullets are true
* \[FG\]
  * The expression defins the space where one of the dice lands on a \[1\] and 
    the sum of the dice is \[5\],  
  * The expression implies the second dice lands on a \[4\].
* \[EF^c\]
  * The expression defines the space where the _sum_ of the dice is \[odd\] and
    at least one of dice does _not_ land on a \[1\].
* \[EFG\]
  * The expression defines the space where the _sum_ of the dice is \[odd\] 
    and at least one of dice land on a \[1\]
    and sum of the dice is \[5\]
