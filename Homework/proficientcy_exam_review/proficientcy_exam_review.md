Note: Many students have difficulties with certain topics in calculus needed for this course, such as infinite series with positive terms (most calculations involve the geometric series and series derived from it), improper integrals and double integrals (change of variables formula, manipulating Gaussian integrals). Homework assignments and/or quizzes might help students to review this material.

If there is time left over, material from Chapter 9 or 10 can be covered. For chapter 10 students should have access to computers with appropriate software.
