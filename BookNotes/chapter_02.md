## 2.3 Axioms of Probability
* Let
  * \[S\] be the sample spcae.
  * \[E\] an event of the sampele space, \[E \in S\].
  * \[n( E)\] number of time the event \[E\] has occured in the sample space \[S\].
* Then
  * \[P( E) = \lim\limits_{x \to \infty } \]
      * The probability of the event \[E\]
      * The protion of the occurances of common type \[E\]
* Let
  * \[S\] be the sample spcae.
  * \[E\] an event of the sampele space, \[E \in S\].
* Assume a number \[P( E)\] is defined and satisifes the
following three axioms:
  * Axiom 1
      * \[0 \le P( E) \le 1\]
  * Axiom 2
      * \[ P( S) = 1\]
  * Axiom 3
      * For any sequence of mutually exclusive events \[E_1, E_2, \dots where \[E_i E_j = \emptyset\] when \[i \notequal j\], then
          * \[P\left( \bigcup\limits_{ i = 1}^{ \infty}{ E_i}\right) 
            = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{\infty}{ P( E_i)}\]
